    "<h2>Overview</h2><p>Environment Variables covers scoped environment control and reproducible sessions. This advanced section assumes you already know the basics and want faster, safer workflows.</p>",
    "<h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>Make sure you are comfortable with basic navigation, listing, and reading manual pages before applying these techniques.</p>",
    "<h2>Why it matters</h2><p>Advanced users save time by reducing ambiguity and verifying results quickly. These patterns help you avoid subtle mistakes.</p>",
    "<h2>Example: baseline command</h2><p>Start from a reliable baseline and expand from there.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ env | sort | head\nHOME=/home/user\n</code></pre><p>Confirm you understand every flag before stacking more.</p>",
    "<h2>Example: inspection</h2><p>Inspect system state before you change anything.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ export PATH=\"$HOME/bin:$PATH\"\nsample output\n</code></pre><p>Write down what you expect the output to show.</p>",
    "<h2>Example: controlled execution</h2><p>Use controlled execution to reduce side effects.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ printenv LANG\nPATH=/usr/bin:/bin\n</code></pre><p>Prefer dry runs or read-only checks when available.</p>",
    "<h2>Example: repeatability</h2><p>Make the command easy to repeat or script.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ env -i HOME=\"$HOME\" bash --noprofile --norc\nHOME=/home/user\n</code></pre><p>Keep commands small and composable.</p>",
    "<h2>Example: verification step</h2><p>Always verify the change after running a command.</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ VAR=1 command --flag\nsample output\n</code></pre><p>Verification is what makes advanced workflows safe.</p>",
    "<h2>Performance notes</h2><p>Use targeted queries and narrow filters. Broad scans can be slow or noisy on large systems.</p>",
    "<h2>Safety checklist</h2><p>Double-check paths, confirm targets, and avoid running destructive commands without backups.</p>",
    "<h2>Troubleshooting</h2><p>If output is unexpected, simplify the command and add flags one by one to isolate the issue.</p>",
    "<h2>Practice tasks</h2><p>Apply the examples in a practice folder, then explain the output in your own words.</p>",
    "<h2>Recap</h2><p>You now have advanced patterns for Environment Variables. Use them consistently to build speed and accuracy.</p>"

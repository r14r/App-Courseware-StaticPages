    "<h2>Concept</h2><p>This topic explores playwright/e2e for streamlit within the context of Streamlit. You will learn how to apply the concept to build robust, maintainable, and user-friendly apps.</p>",
    "<h2>Why it matters</h2><p>Advanced Streamlit patterns let you ship production-ready apps with fewer surprises. Mastery here improves user experience, performance, and long-term maintainability.</p>",
    "<h2>Core APIs / Syntax</h2><p>Below are minimal examples that illustrate the essential APIs and patterns.</p>",

    "<h2>Common pitfalls</h2><p>• Overusing reruns without caching can cause sluggish UIs.\n• Global mutable state can create race conditions with callbacks.\n• Disconnected page-level state harms UX.\n• Not profiling heavy code paths leads to timeouts.</p>",
    "<h2>Practice</h2><p>1) Extend the example to a realistic scenario.\n2) Add validation and error handling.\n3) Measure the impact (latency, memory) and document your findings.</p>"
